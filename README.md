# react-native-video-player

IOS react-native app rendering a Kickstarter video and using external controllers 

## Getting Started

You'll want to make sure your version of node is compatible with React Native. Version 8.9.0 seemed to have the least amount of issues. 

Download your technologies and then run the commands in your command line.
